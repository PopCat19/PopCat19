## Me
I'm PopCat19 (or kat) and I can't code. Though, I do vibe coding for fun.

I'm lazy, so instead of going through proper means for a solution, I suffer by making things overcomplicated just for a solution. 

I'm comfortable at prompting. I've been messing with LLMs since GPT 3.5 and Pygmalion 6B were released. I've also experimented with Stable Diffusion and [anime|pastel] finetuned models like WaifuDiffusion and AnythingV3 alike. Though, I've leaned off imagegen in favor of learning to draw 2D illustrations.

I think cats are chill.

### What do I do
I don't do much. Mostly sleep, watch YouTube/[Anime](https://anilist.co/user/popcat19/), listen to [music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV_Dz6w68lZ1eS6_VLAKNJCgBjBYhL3bd), read through Danbooru/Pixiv, and sometimes check out cool projects to try. That said, I'm interested in doing [2D Illustrations](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/89345370), composing music, and learn Rust and TypeScript someday.

I do vibe code some projects like [`img-glsl-webui`](https://github.com/PopCat19/img-glsl-webui) for having something to render screen shaders on an image. Something I wanted where none were present/satiable.

I used to play [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27223591) frequently, so I made a [`Project-Minimalist`](https://github.com/PopCat19/Project-Minimalist) skin in Figma. It turned out better than I'd expected, and learned plenty about Figma and even made a custom palette, which a webui of it is hosted in [`minimalist-palette-web`](https://github.com/PopCat19/minimalist-palette-web) repo.

I've also recently started using NixOS, so [`popcat19-nixos-hm`](https://github.com/PopCat19/popcat19-nixos-hm) hosts my configurations to make it reproducible, which I also like. Since most of it is vibe coded, I'll have to clean some files such as unneeded fish functions.

Speaking of NixOS, I'm also trying to get it running (with LLM guidance) under [`shimboot`](https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot) by [`ading2210`](https://github.com/ading2210). It's based on an exploit [Mercury Workshop team](https://sh1mmer.me/) discovered where we can replace RMA shim's rootfs with anything we want, albeit with kernel limitations, of course.\

It's been a challenge due to both my inexperience and how ChromeOS shim kernel has unique quirks that makes it difficult to get non-FHS distro like NixOS running there. The repo is [`nixos-shimboot`](https://github.com/PopCat19/nixos-shimboot), which as of now doesn't boot into a DE/WM or even getty (yet).

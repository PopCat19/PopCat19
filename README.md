## Me
I'm PopCat19 (or kat, if pronouns matter: `they/he`) and I like to procrastinate.

Despite lacking the experience in programming fundamentals, I enjoy LLM vibecoding (on a budget) due to its ease and subjectively lazy nature, hence why my recent projects are being developed with LLM contributions.

I'm lazy: Instead of going through proper means for a solution, whether it be simple or otherwise, I voluntarily suffer by making things overcomplicated just for a solution. 

My ethnicity is half Japanese/Filipino, though I haven't spoken Japanese as my native language since 2015.

I've been navigating through anhedonia and executive dysfunction recently. Hopefully something nice happens along the way.

### Interests
I don't do much. Mostly sleep, rethink life, watch YouTube, listen to [music](https://rentry.org/popcat19-curation0), occasionally watch [Anime](https://anilist.co/user/popcat19/), peek through (Dan)booru/Pixiv, and sometimes check out cool projects to mess with.\
|\
That being said, I'm interested in drawing/designing [2D Illustrations](https://www.pixiv.net/users/89345370), composing music (with open-source projects like Beepbox Mods, LMMS, Ardour, or Furnace), and learn Bash, Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Kotlin for fun projects someday.\
|\
I personally feel more inclined to learn music, as my aspiration of the artists mentioned in [my curation](https://rentry.org/popcat19-curation0) keeps growing. Though, I also want to grow my own style in illustrations and create visualizers once I gain enough Rust knowledge.\
`(Of course, because of the recent LLM surge I may voluntarily have them assist beyond boilerplates in such journeys whilst making it fun ^^)`\
|\
TMI: I'll also try to rely on personal or commissioned illustrations over diffusion models for my own interest. I find the experience more valuable than the result in the illustrative space.

### ML Exploration
I've been comfortable at prompting for a while. I've been messing with LLMs since GPT 3.5, Pygmalion 6B, and a while when [character.ai's blue-hat-dude mascot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1fh3bsa/yall_what_happened_to_the_blue_guy_old_cai_logo/) still existed.\
|\
I've also experimented with Stable Diffusion and [anime|[pastel](https://huggingface.co/mirroring/pastel-mix)] finetuned models like  [WaifuDiffusion](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion) and [AnythingV3](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0) alike, usually within [artbot](https://artbot.site/) or locally with [comfyui](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)\
`(~10min gens on the puny 2GB VRAM of the GTX 750Ti www)`\
|\
TMI: I've leaned off imagegen early 2024 in favor of learning to draw 2D illustrations.

### Linux

#### Migration Journey
**Late 2023:** My first dual-boot distro was [Zorin OS 16](https://zorin.com/os/) alongside my primary [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021](https://archive.org/details/en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f_202301) installation.\
`(I didn't run sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root / on that install)`\
|\
**Late 2023:** My full transition distro was [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) due to its intuitive (and homely?) nature.\
`(don't mind how reinstalling Windows 10 nuked my mounted sdb bootloader with BOOTMGR, giving me all the more incentive to switch www)`\
|\
**Early 2024:** Hopped onto [OpenSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) since rolling-release and stability seemed interesting.\
|\
**Early 2024:** Then installed my first [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with [SomeOrdinaryGamers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JYIAaLrwcY)'s walkthrough video, with another attempt using the [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) alone.\
`(Took me about 8 hours of trial to install with the Installation Guide; everytime I mess up I had to reset and redo everything... ;-;)`\
|\
**Early 2024:** I moved to [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/) and every felt great with their options and optimizations, especially on my previous PC from the 2014-era.\
|\
**Mid 2025:** I moved to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) with the [minimal/manual installation guide](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation-manual) due to btrfs root snapshot overflow shinanigans with CachyOS.\
`I had separate parts for root and /home, root was so small that every update fills up the entire part with snapshots. It's been painful rebooting into TTY just to manually cleanup and rebalance...)`\
|\
TMI: My actual linux encounter was much earlier, where I had to use Linux Mint's LiveISO when I was installing [BrunchFramework ChromeOS](https://github.com/sebanc/brunch) on a poor Intel Celeron N3000 laptop with 512GB 5200rpm HDD that barely runs the YouTube website itself or even stream 480p on Firefox/Chromium running Arch Linux Xfce.\
`(I hate that 'they' still sell these kind of stuff, just adopt a used T480 with dual battery for <$140 USD on ebay)`

### Desk Setup

#### Desk
I'm using a:\
`☆☆ Generic Reversible L-Shaped Desk (Option A Edition) ☆☆`

#### Desk Stuff
Generally, my desk as of 2025.12 had:
- Monitors: MSI MAG271VCR, Dell S2415H
- Peripherals: COSTOM WK87 (womier fork), Razer DeathAdder V2, GAOMON S620, 8BitDo Ultimate (w/ dock), AKAI MPK mini play, Beats Studio Pro, and 3x Large Diet Pepsi.
- Thinkpad: T480 (dim FHD IPS, no FP, no BLKB) + chinese 'SANYO' 61++ slice with \~80Wh capacity...\
  `(idk bro TLP says energy_full has 80060 mWh over its 71280 mWh energy_full_design even after recalibration, heck it even charges and force-discharges ~80Wh too???)`

#### Main Rig (on desk)
I've initially used [Lenovo K450e](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/Lenovo_Desktops/Lenovo_K450e/Lenovo_K450e_Spec.PDF) with [EVGA NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750Ti ACX](https://www.evga.com/products/specs/gpu.aspx?pn=6a8f5e91-8aa1-49f6-9a4a-8ae25cad9d25) and [Samsung 870 Evo 1 TB 2.5" Solid State Drive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QBJ2YMG). 

Only until 2023.11 had I build my personal, curated main rig by pure research and budget with [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/popcat19/saved/FDXtWZ):
```
- AMD Ryzen 5 5500 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor
- Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black Edition 42 CFM CPU Cooler
- MSI PRO B550M-VC WIFI Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard
- Timetec PINNACLE Konduit 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory
- Samsung 870 Evo 1 TB 2.5" Solid State Drive (reused)
- XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Core Radeon RX 7800 XT 16 GB Video Card (christmas gift)
- Zalman P10 MicroATX Mini Tower Case (discounted to $55.99)
- Corsair RM850e (2025) 850 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply (christmas gift)
- Thermalright TL-S12-S 47.6 CFM 120 mm Fan (TLS12-S X3)
- Clovertale Braided ATX Sleeved Cable Extension kit for Power Supply Cable Kit 10 Pack (Black)
```

### Subjectively Notable Projects

#### Project Minimalist
I used to play [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27223591) frequently, so I made a [`Project-Minimalist`](https://github.com/PopCat19/Project-Minimalist) skin in Figma. It turned out better than I'd expected, and learned plenty about Figma and even made a custom palette, which a webui of it is hosted in [`minimalist-palette-web`](https://github.com/PopCat19/minimalist-palette-web) repo.

#### NixOS Novice
[`popcat19-nixos`](https://github.com/PopCat19/popcat19-nixos) includes my very first NixOS configuration prior to Home-Manager Flake transition. It's a thousand line mess built from the original NixOS configuration you'd get from the installer that lived in `/etc/nixos/`.\
`(I had to Ctrl+F to configure and add packages... TwT)`

#### WebGL Image Shader
I did vibecode some projects like [`img-glsl-webui`](https://github.com/PopCat19/img-glsl-webui) for having something to render screen shaders on an image. Something I wanted where none were present/satiable.\
`(I should refactor/rewrite it to use WebGL 2.0 sometime)`

#### NixOS Flake Config
[`popcat19-nixos-hm`](https://github.com/PopCat19/popcat19-nixos-hm) hosts my current NixOS configurations for multiple hosts to make it simply reproducible, which I also like. Most of it, usually flake and home-manager (module) configuration is vibecoded, except for the minimal installation, since it felt like installing Arch Linux for the first time.\
`(theming in HM is such a pain. Why do KDE app themes like Dolphin have to differ from the qt6ct ones?)`

#### NixOS Shimboot
Speaking of NixOS, I'm also trying to get it running on Chromebooks (with LLM contributions) in [`nixos-shimboot`](https://github.com/PopCat19/nixos-shimboot), which is forked from [`shimboot`](https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot) by [`ading2210`](https://github.com/ading2210). It's based on an exploit [Mercury Workshop team](https://sh1mmer.me/) discovered where we can replace RMA shim's rootfs with anything we want, albeit with kernel limitations, of course.\
|\
It's been a challenge due to my inexpertise in Nix and unique quirks from the ChromeOS shim kernel that makes it untrivial to get a non-FHS distro like NixOS running there.\
|\
Update 2025.12: I've been using it daily and it runs, somehow stable (except for rebuilds, eats time copying caches).\
|\
Just needs board testing (I've only got it running on `dedede`), bwrap workarounds, UWSM+SDDM compatibility, busybox generation select script (like systemd-boot), CI workflows, and better project docs. It should be good for a beta release afterwards.
